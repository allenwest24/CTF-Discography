The encoded message we had was: AGHFXK{5ai5b1cee10z}
I wrote a script to solve this.
The general idea is that you can tell from the beginning that AGHFXK is supposed to translate to AFFCTF.
So I tried the logic of a rolling caesar cipher, where each letter gets shifted, incrementing up by one each time.
This gave me an invalid password so I tried the same logic but excluded no alphabet characters from the shift/increment.
This worked, as demonstrated by the python script in this directory.
